# Ankama Launcher
 Ankama launcher with a more personal touch so it doesn't feel like a generic launcher and more like a warmer one.

<br/>

## Main goals ?
* For fun
* More Flutter skills
* Official Ankama launcher is "laggy", isn't smooth and is resource intensive -> **I hate that**
* I wanted to see how Flutter Desktop behaves
